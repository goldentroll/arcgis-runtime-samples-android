# Display a Map

![Display a Map App](display-map.png)

The **Display Map** app is the most basic Map app for the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/android/).
It shows how to inflate a ```MapView``` in the layout XML of the activity, create a ```Map``` with a static ```Basemap.createImagery()``` and bind the ```Map``` to the ```MapView```.  By default, this map supports basic zooming and panning operations.
