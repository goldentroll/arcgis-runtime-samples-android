# Custom dictionary style

Use a custom dictionary style (.stylx) to symbolize features using a variety of attribute values.

## Use case

When symbolizing geoelements in your map, you may need to convey several pieces of information with a single symbol. You could try to symbolize such data using a unique value renderer, but as the number of fields and values increases, that approach becomes impractical. With a dictionary renderer you can build each symbol on-the-fly, driven by one or more attribute values, and handle a nearly infinite number of unique combinations.

## How to use the sample

Pan and zoom the map to see the symbology from the custom dictionary style.

## How it works

1. Create a new `DictionarySymbolStyle` by passing in the path to the custom style file (.stylx).
2. Create a new `DictionaryRenderer`, providing the dictionary symbol style.
3. Apply the dictionary renderer to a feature layer.

## About the data

The layer showing a subset of [restaurants in Redlands, CA](https://services2.arcgis.com/ZQgQTuoyBrtmoGdP/arcgis/rest/services/Redlands_Restaurants/FeatureServer)  with attributes for rating, style, health score, and open hours is symbolized using a dictionary renderer that displays a single symbol for all of these variables. The renderer uses symbols from a [custom dictionary style](https://arcgisruntime.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=751138a2e0844e06853522d54103222a) to show unique symbols based on several feature attributes. The symbols it contains were created using ArcGIS Pro. The logic used to apply the symbols comes from an Arcade script embedded in the stylx file (which is a SQLite database), along with a JSON string that defines expected attribute names and configuration properties.
