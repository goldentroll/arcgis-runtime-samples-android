# Edit and sync features
Synchronize offline edits with a feature service.

## How to use the sample
1. Pan and zoom into the desired area, making sure the area you want to take offline is within the current extent of the `MapView`. 
1. Tap on the Generate Geodatabase button. This will call `generateGeodatabase()`, which will return a `GenerateGeodatabaseJob`. 
1. Once the job completes successfully, a `GeodatabaseFeatureTable` and a `FeatureLayer` are created from the resulting `Geodatabase`. The `FeatureLayer` is then added to the `ArcGISMap`. 
1. Once the `FeatureLayer` generated from the local `Geodatabase` is displayed, a `Feature` can be selected by tapping on it. The selected `Feature` can be moved to a new location by tapping anywhere on the map. 
1. Once a successful edit has been made to the `FeatureLayer`, the Sync Geodatabase button is enabled. This button synchronizes local edits made to the local `GeoDatabase` with the remote feature service using `syncGeodatabase()` which generates `SyncGeodatbaseParameters` and passes them to a `SyncGeodatabaseJob`.
1. Once the job successfully completes, the local edits are synchronized with the feature service.

## How it works
1. Create a `GeodatabaseSyncTask` from a URL.
1. Use `createDefaultGenerateGeodatabaseParametersAsync(...)` to create `GenerateGeodatabaseParameters` from the `GeodatabaseSyncTask`, passing in an `Envelope` argument.
1. Create a `GenerateGeodatabaseJob` from the `GeodatabaseSyncTask` using `generateGeodatabaseAsync(...)` passing in parameters and a path to the local geodatabase.
1. Start the `GenerateGeodatabaseJob` and, on success, load the `Geodatabase`.
1. On successful loading, call `getGeodatabaseFeatureTables()` on the `Geodatabase` and add it to the `ArcGISMap`'s operational layers.
1. To sync changes between the local and web geodatabases:
  1. Define `SyncGeodatabaseParameters` including setting the `SyncGeodatabaseParameters.SyncDirection`.
  1. Create a `SyncGeodatabaseJob` from `GeodatabaseSyncTask` using `.syncGeodatabaseAsync(...)` passing the `SyncGeodatabaseParameters` and `Geodatabase` as arguments.
  1. Start the `SyncGeodatabaseJob`.

## Offline data
1. Download the data from [ArcGIS Online](https://arcgisruntime.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=72e703cd01654e7796eb1ae75af1cb53).  
2. Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file to disk.  
3. Create an ArcGIS/samples/MapPackage folder on your device. You can use the [Android Debug Bridge (adb)](https://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/adb.html) tool found in **<sdk-dir>/platform-tools**.
4. Open up a command prompt and execute the ```adb shell``` command to start a remote shell on your target device.
5. Navigate to your sdcard directory, e.g. ```cd /sdcard/```.  
6. Create the ArcGIS/samples/TileCache directory, ```mkdir ArcGIS/samples/TileCache```.
7. You should now have the following directory on your target device, ```/sdcard/ArcGIS/samples/TileCache```. We will copy the contents of the downloaded data into this directory. Note:  Directory may be slightly different on your device.
8. Exit the shell with the, ```exit``` command.
9. While still in your command prompt, navigate to the folder where you extracted the contents of the data from step 1 and execute the following command: 
	* ```adb push SanFrancisco.tpk /sdcard/ArcGIS/samples/TileCache```
