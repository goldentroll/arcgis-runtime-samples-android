# Feature layer extrusion

Extrude features based on their attributes.

## Use case

Extrusion is the process of stretching a flat, 2D shape vertically to create a 3D object in a scene. For example, you can extrude building polygons by a height value to create three-dimensional building shapes.

## How to use the sample

Tap the toggle to switch between using population density and total population for extrusion. Higher extrusion directly corresponds to higher attribute values.

## How it works

1. Create a `ServiceFeatureTable` from a URL.
2. Create a feature layer from the service feature table.
   * Make sure to set the rendering mode to dynamic, `statesFeatureLayer.setRenderingMode(RenderingMode.DYNAMIC)`.
3. Apply a `SimpleRenderer` to the feature layer.
4. Set the `ExtrusionMode` of the renderer with `renderer.getSceneProperties().setExtrusionMode(SceneProperties.ExtrusionMode.ABSOLUTE_HEIGHT)`.
5. Set the extrusion expression of the renderer with `renderer.getSceneProperties().setExtrusionExpression("[POP2007]/ 10")`.
