# Raster layer (file)

Create and use a raster layer made from a local raster file.

## Use case

Rasters can be digital aerial photographs, imagery from satellites, digital pictures, or even scanned maps. An end-user will frequently need to import raster files acquired through various data-collection methods into their map to view and analyze the data.

## How to use the sample

When the sample starts, a raster will be loaded from a file and displayed in the map view.

## How it works

1. Create a `Raster` from a raster file.
2. Create a `RasterLayer` from the raster.
3. Add it as an operational layer with `map.getOperationalLayers().add(rasterLayer)`.

## Relevant API

* Raster
* RasterLayer

## Additional information

See the topic [What is raster data?](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/raster-and-images/what-is-raster-data.htm) in the *ArcMap* documentation for more information about raster images.

## Offline data
1. Download the **raster-file.zip** data from [ArcGIS Online](https://arcgisruntime.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=7c4c679ab06a4df19dc497f577f111bd).  
2. Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file to disk.  
3. Create an ArcGIS/samples/raster folder on your device. You can use the [Android Debug Bridge (adb)](https://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/adb.html) tool found in **<sdk-dir>/platform-tools**.
4. Open up a command prompt and execute the `adb shell` command to start a remote shell on your target device.
5. Navigate to your sdcard directory, e.g. `cd /sdcard/`.  
6. Create the ArcGIS/samples directory, `mkdir ArcGIS/samples/raster`.
7. You should now have the following directory on your target device, `/sdcard/ArcGIS/samples/raster`. We will copy the contents of the downloaded data into this directory. Note:  Directory may be slightly different on your device.
8. Exit the shell with the, `exit` command.
9. While still in your command prompt, navigate to the root folder where you extracted the contents of the data from step 1 and execute the following command: 
	* `adb push raster-file/. /sdcard/ArcGIS/samples/raster`
