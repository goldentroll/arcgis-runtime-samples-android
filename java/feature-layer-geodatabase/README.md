# Feature layer (GeoDatabase)
Consume an Esri mobile geodatabase by using a `FeatureLayer` and a `GeodatabaseFeatureTable`.

## How to use the sample
Simply run the app and grant read permissions.

## How it works
The sample creates an instance of `GeodatabaseFeatureTable` by supplying a path to a local mobile geodatabase. The `FeatureLayer` is then supplied with the `GeodatabaseFeatureTable` and added to the Map. The mobile geodatabase can either be obtained through ArcMap, with the Create Runtime Content geoprocessing tool, or through a feature service with the `GeodatabaseSyncTask`.
