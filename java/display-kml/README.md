# Display KML

Display KML from a URL, portal item, or local KML file.

## Use case

Keyhole Markup Language (KML) is a data format used by Google Earth. KML is popular as a transmission format for consumer use and for sharing geographic data between apps. You can use Runtime to display KML files, with full support for a variety of features, including network links, 3D models, screen overlays, and tours.

## How to use the sample

Use the overflow menu to select a source. A KML file from that source will be loaded and displayed in the map.

## How it works

1. To create a KML layer from a URL, create a `KmlDataset` using the URL to the KML file. Then pass the dataset to the `KmlLayer` constructor.
2. To create a KML layer from a portal item, construct a `PortalItem` with a `Portal` and the KML portal item ID. Pass the portal item to the `KmlLayer` constructor.
3. To create a KML layer from a local file, create a `KmlDataset` using the absolute file path to the local KML file. Then pass the dataset to the `KmlLayer` constructor.
4. Add the layer as an operational layer to the map with `map.getOperationalLayers().add(kmlLayer)`.

## Relevant API

* KmlDataset
* KmlLayer

## Offline Data

1. Download the data from [ArcGIS Online](https://arcgisruntime.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=324e4742820e46cfbe5029ff2c32cb1f).
2. Open your command prompt and navigate to the folder where you extracted the contents of the data from step 1.
3. Push the data into the scoped storage of the sample app:
`adb push US_State_Capitals.kml /Android/data/com.esri.arcgisruntime.sample.displaykml/files/US_State_Capitals.kml`

## About the data

This sample displays three different KML files:

* From URL - this is a map of the significant weather outlook produced by NOAA/NWS. It uses KML network links to always show the latest data.
* From local file - this is a map of U.S. state capitals. It doesn't define an icon, so the default pushpin is used for the points.
* From portal item - this is a map of U.S. states.
