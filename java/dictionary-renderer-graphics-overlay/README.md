# Dictionary Renderer with Graphics Overlay

The dictionary renderer creates graphics using a local mil2525d style file and a XML file with key, value attributes for each graphic.

## How it works

This sample loads a number of point, line, and polygon military elements from an XML file and adds them as graphics to a `GraphicsOverlay`. A `DictionaryRenderer` is applied to the `GraphicsOverlay` in order to display the graphics with MIL-STD-2525D military symbology.

## Offline data

1. Download the data from the table below.
2. Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file to disk.  
3. Create an ArcGIS/samples/Dictionary folder on your device. You can use the [Android Debug Bridge (adb)](https://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/adb.html) tool found in **<sdk-dir>/platform-tools**.
4. Open up a command prompt and execute the `adb shell` command to start a remote shell on your target device.
5. Navigate to your sdcard directory, e.g. `cd /sdcard/`.  
6. Create the ArcGIS/samples/Dictionary directory, `mkdir ArcGIS/samples/Dictionary`.
7. You should now have the following directory on your target device, `/sdcard/ArcGIS/samples/Dictionary`. We will copy the contents of the downloaded data into this directory. Note:  Directory may be slightly different on your device.
8. Exit the shell with the, `exit` command.
9. While still in your command prompt, navigate to the folder where you extracted the contents of the data from step 1 and execute the following command: 
	* `adb push mil2525d.stylx /sdcard/ArcGIS/samples/Dictionary`
