# Create terrain from a local raster

Set the terrain surface with elevation described by a raster file.

![Create terrain from a local raster](create-terrain-from-a-local-raster.png)

## Use case

The terrain surface is what the basemap, operational layers, and graphics are draped on. Supported raster formats include:

* ASRP/USRP
* CIB1, 5, 10
* DTED0, 1, 2
* GeoTIFF
* HFA
* HRE
* IMG
* JPEG
* JPEG 2000
* NITF
* PNG
* RPF
* SRTM1, 2

## How it works

1. Create an `ArcGISScene` and add it to a `SceneView`.
1. Create a `RasterElevationSource` with a list of raster file paths.
1. Add this source to the scene's base surface: `ArcGISScene.getBaseSurface().getElevationSources().add(RasterElevationSource)`.
