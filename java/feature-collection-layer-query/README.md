## How to use the sample
Simply run the app.

## How it works
A query is performed using the `.queryFeaturesAsync(queryParameters)` method on `FeatureTable`. The result of the query is used to instantiate an `FeatureCollectionTable`. The table is used to instantiate an `FeatureCollection` which is then use to initialize a `FeatureCollectionLayer`. The layer is then displayed on the map by adding it to the operational layers array.
