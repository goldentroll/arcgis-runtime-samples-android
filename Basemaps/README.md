# Basemaps

The Basemaps sample app shows how you can switch basemaps, by showing choices on the Android options menu or action bar overflow, and using the MapOptions.MapType enum, the MapOptions class, and the setMapOptions method on the MapView. The setExtent and setOnStatusChangedListener methods on the MapView are used to preserve the current extent of the map when the basemap is changed.
