# Switch Maps
This sample shows a way to switch between two different maps in a single app by leveraging the Android Fragments pattern. In this app, a single MapActivity contains a MapFragment that in turn contains a MapView. When the button on the action bar is pressed, the existing MapFragment is replaced by a new instance of the MapFragment that has different map contents. The current extent of the MapView is preserved when switching between fragments, by making use of the retainState and restoreState methods on the MapView. This sample requires Android API level 15 and above, although you can adapt it for use with older versions by using the [Android Support Library](http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/index.html).
