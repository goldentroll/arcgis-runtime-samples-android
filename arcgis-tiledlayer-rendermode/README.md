## How to use the sample
The ArcGIS Tile Layer Render Mode app uses a Tiled layer basemap from an ArcGIS Online service URL. The **RenderMode** spinner lets to select the various possible Render Modes. The user can zoom in/out on the map to visually observe the impact of the Render Mode selected. You can navigate to the predefined Tiled layer scales using the seekbar. The seekbar scale values are displayed in a TextView located at top right corner of MapView. The user can also do fine-grained zoom in/out operations using gestures on the MapView.
