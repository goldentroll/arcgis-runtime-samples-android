# Overview
ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android v10.2.5 samples for Android Studio.  The repo contains an [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) project with multi-project sample app modules that can be run from within the Android Studio IDE.

# Prerequisites
* The samples are building with ```compileSdkVersion 21``` which requires [JDK 7 or higher](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

# Developer Instructions
The **ArcGIS Android SDK Samples** are [Gradle](https://www.gradle.org) based Android projects which can be directly cloned and imported into Android Studio.

## Fork the repo
If you haven't already, fork the [this repo](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-android-sdk-gradle-samples/fork).
