# Overview
ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android Early Access Preview Samples for Android Studio.  The ArcGIS Android SDK Gradle samples depends on the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android library module for Android Studio](https://github.com/ArcGIS/arcgis-android-api-lib-module) you will need to clone both repositories and add the ArcGIS Android API Library Module to the gradle sample project.  

# Early Access Preview
**Caution:** The ArcGIS Android SDK Gradle samples are currently available as an **early access preview** for use with [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) and the [ArcGIS Android API Library Module](https://github.com/ArcGIS/arcgis-android-api-lib-module).  If you are not comfortable using an unfinished product, you may want to use ArcGIS Android Samples in the Eclipse Plugin bundled with the [ArcGIS Android SDK](https://developers.arcgis.com/android/).

# Prerequisites
- [JDK 6 or higher](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
- [Android Studio (Beta) 0.8.0+](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) with support for gradle plugin ```0.12.+```.  
- Android Support Repository.  Ensure that your SDK Manager for Android Studio has the [support repository](https://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/setup.html) installed.  We make use of [v7 appcompat library](http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/features.html#v7-appcompat) to follow [Android design guidelines](http://developer.android.com/design/index.html). Please ensure you have the latest version of the Android Support Library installed with your Android SDK.

# Developer Instructions
The **ArcGIS Android SDK Samples** are Gradle based Android projects which can be directly cloned and imported into Android Studio.  The **ArcGIS Android SDK Samples** require the **ArcGIS Android API Library Module** to be imported into the **ArcGIS Android SDK Samples** project.

## Fork the repo
If you haven't already, go to https://github.com/ArcGIS/arcgis-android-sdk-gradle-samples and click the **Fork** button and go to https://github.com/ArcGIS/arcgis-android-api-lib-module and click the **Fork** button.

## Clone the repo

### Android Studio
[Clone the **ArcGIS Android SDK Samples** and **ArcGIS Android API Library Module** in Android Studio](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/webhelp/cloning-a-repository-from-github.html).

### Command line Git
[Clone the **ArcGIS Android SDK Samples** and **ArcGIS Android API Library Module**](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo#step-2-clone-your-fork)

Open your terminal, navigate to your working directory, use ```git clone``` to get a copy of the repo.

```
# Clones your fork of the repository into the current directory in terminal
$ git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/arcgis-android-sdk-gradle-samples.git
$ git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/arcgis-android-api-lib-module.git
```

** Now that we have both repos cloned locally we can begin to import our gradle samples project and add the **ArcGIS Android API Library Module** module to that project as a dependency.**

## Import Gradle Sample project into Android Studio
Once the project is cloned to disk you can import into Android Studio:

* From the toolbar select **File > Import Project**
* Navigate to the root project folder, *arcgis-android-sdk-gradle-samples* and click **OK**

## Add ArcGIS Android library module
This is where we start to turn our project into an ArcGIS for Android project.

* Right Click your project and select **Open Module Settings**
* Click the ```+``` sign above **SDK Location** and select **Import Existing Project** then click **Next**
* Navigate to the folder where you cloned the ```arcgis-android-api-lib-module``` repo and select the ```arcgis-android-v10.2.3``` folder which contains the library module.  Do not import the entire project, just the library module e.g. ```/[path-to-repo]/arcgis-android-api-lib-module/arcgis-android-v10.2.3``` and click **OK** then **Finish** to import the library module.

**NOTE** If you navigate to the root project directory you will see all available modules listed.  Ensure that ```arcgis-android-v10.2.3``` module is select from your project and that the **app** module is unchecked.

## Run a sample
You should now be able to run any of the included samples.  We will use the ```HelloWorld``` Sample as an example.  

* Select ```HelloWorld``` from the **Select Run/Dubug Configuration** drop down
* Click the **Run** button
