# Overview
ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android Early Access Preview Samples for Android Studio

# Early Access Preview
**Caution:** The ArcGIS Android SDK Gradle samples are currently available as an **early access preview** for use with [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) and the [ArcGIS Android API Library Module](https://github.com/ArcGIS/arcgis-android-api-lib-module).  If you are not comfortable using an unfinished product, you may want to use ArcGIS Android Samples in the Eclipse Plugin bundled with the [ArcGIS Android SDK](https://developers.arcgis.com/android/).
