# Overview
ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android v100.7.0 samples.  The `master` branch of this repository contains sample app modules for the latest available version of the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android](https://developers.arcgis.com/android/). Samples released under older versions can be found through the [git tags](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-android/tags).  Please read our [wiki](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-android/wiki) for help with working with this repository.  

# Prerequisites
* The samples are building with `compileSdkVersion 28`
* [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

## SDK Maven repo
The SDK is available through the Bintray Maven repo, you can take a look at the repository with the link below: 

[ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/esri/arcgis/arcgis-android/images/download.svg?version=100.7.0) ](https://bintray.com/esri/arcgis/arcgis-android/100.7.0/link)

## Developer Instructions
Please read our [developer instructions wiki page](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-android/wiki/dev-instructions) to set up your developer environment with Android Studio.  Instructions include forking and cloning the repository for those new to Git.

## Run a sample
Once you have set up your developer environment you can run any sample from within Android Studio by selecting the app module from the **Edit Configurations** drop down and clicking the **Run** button from the toolbar. 

### Build/Run sample from Gradle
You can execute all the build tasks using the [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) command line tool. It's available as a batch file for Windows (gradlew.bat) and a shell script for Linux/Mac (gradlew.sh) and it is accessible from the root of the project.  

- Build a debug APK

```
$ ./gradlew assembleDebug
```

- Run the app

**Device**
```
adb -d install path/to/sample.apk
```

Built APK's are saved to **arcgis-runtime-samples-android/[module-name]/build/outputs/apk/**. More information about running apps on devices can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device.html).

### Run samples through the sample viewer
The samples in this repository can also be viewed in a single sample viewer app. It can be found on the Play Store or [on ArcGIS Online](https://arcgisruntime.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=6a214d1f4a374a9a873891707c0411ec). If downloading from ArcGIS Online, follow these instructions to run the app locally on your device:
1. Download and unzip the file to get the apk **ArcGIS_Runtime_Sample_Viewer_Android_1007.apk**.
1. Install the APK with adb: 
```
adb -d install path/to/ArcGIS_Runtime_Sample_Viewer_Android_1007.apk
```
