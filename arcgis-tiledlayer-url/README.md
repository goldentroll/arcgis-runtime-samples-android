# ArcGIS Tiled Layer URL

![Tiled Layer from URL App](tiledlayer-from-url.png)

The ArcGIS Tile Layer URL app is the most basic Map app for the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/android/) using Tiled Layer basemap from an ArcGIS Online service URL.
It shows how to inflate a MapView in the layout XML of the activity, create a Tiled Layer from an ArcGIS Online service URL and bind that to a ```Basemap```.  The ```Basemap``` is used to create a ```Map``` which is used inside of the ```MapView```.
By default, this map supports basic zooming and panning operations.
